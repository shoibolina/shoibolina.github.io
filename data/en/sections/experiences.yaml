  - designation: Road Network Extraction from Historical Atlanta maps
    start: Jan 2025
    end: May 2025
    responsibilities:
    - Led the technical development of a 4-person, cross-functional team for an image segmentation pipeline to automate road extraction from 150+ years of historical maps of Atlanta, reducing manual tracing efforts using ArcGIS by 95%
    - Fine-tuned NVIDIA SegFormer-B0 on “DHK 200 Turkey” map tiles (15-epoch AdamW + Dice-loss; validation Dice > 0.85) and warm-started that checkpoint on 1974 Atlanta maps for 200 more epochs, raising best Dice from 0.88 to 0.91
    - Automated large-scale inference by stitching tile-level predictions into a dimension-matched GeoTIFF and hardened GPU workflows with proactive memory clears plus standardized mask polarity, eliminating out of memory (OOM) errors

  - designation: Road Network Extraction from Historical Atlanta maps
    start: Jan 2024
    end: Jul 2024
    responsibilities:
    - Collaborated with Division of Physical Therapy in a 4-person team to develop a cost-effective, marker-less classification model for gait features to enable healthcare professionals to monitor mobility changes and detect early signs of gait abnormalities
    - Generated biomarker keypoint datasets from over 300 mobile phone videos (~250 GB) using Python, and implemented ETL processes to prepare data for machine learning, achieving 91% classification accuracy on the best model
    - Stored and managed the generated keypoint data on the department’s high-performance computing cluster, enabling scalable ccess and streamlined processing for subsequent analysis workflows
