  paper:
    summary: This study presents an agile and optimal machine learning approach for detecting inter-ictal states from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, aiming to enhance epilepsy diagnosis and management. By leveraging advanced feature extraction techniques and a robust classification algorithm, the proposed method achieves high accuracy in identifying inter-ictal patterns, which are crucial for understanding seizure dynamics. The model's performance is validated on a comprehensive EEG dataset, demonstrating its potential for real-world clinical applications. This research contributes to the growing field of AI-driven healthcare solutions, offering a promising tool for clinicians in the fight against epilepsy.

  paper:
    summary: A novel blockchain framework is proposed in this paper to facilitate agro financing for farmers in South India. The framework leverages the inherent properties of blockchain technology, such as decentralization, transparency, and immutability, to create a secure and efficient platform for managing agricultural loans and transactions. By utilizing smart contracts, the framework automates the loan approval process, ensuring that farmers receive timely access to funds while minimizing the risk of fraud and default. The proposed solution aims to empower farmers by providing them with greater financial inclusion and reducing their dependence on traditional lending institutions.

  paper:
    summary: Gait impairments are prevalent in various neurological and musculoskeletal conditions, significantly affecting individuals' mobility and quality of life. This study presents a novel approach to classify simulated gait impairments using privacy-preserving explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques applied to mobile phone video data. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the proposed method accurately identifies different types of gait abnormalities while ensuring user privacy through federated learning and differential privacy mechanisms. The explainability aspect of the model provides insights into the decision-making process, enhancing trust and interpretability for clinicians and patients alike. The results demonstrate the potential of this approach in remote health monitoring and rehabilitation, paving the way for accessible and effective gait analysis solutions.
